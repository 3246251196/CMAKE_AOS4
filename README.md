# CMAKE_AOS4
#
# There is no known CMAKE toolchain for our dev/cross-machines. It means that using CMAKE instantly is difficult.
#
# This repository can be used as a starting point. It contains a toolchain.
#
# Disclaimer: I am not well versed in CMAKE. I have spent years
# fighting with it. To try and become friends, here is a toolchain
# that was originally provided by AFXGROUP. See cmake.ppc-amigaos
#
# I welcome ANYONE to create a PR and improve it.
